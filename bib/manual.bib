	abstract = {Token payment systems were the first application of blockchain technology and are still the most widely used one. Early implementations of such systems, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, provide virtually no privacy beyond basic pseudonymity: all transactions are written in plain to the blockchain, which makes them linkable and traceable. Several more recent blockchain systems, such as Monero or Zerocash, implement improved levels of privacy. Most of these systems target the permissionless setting, and as such are not suited for enterprise networks. These require token systems to be permissioned and to bind tokens to user identities instead of pseudonymous addresses. They also require auditing functionalities in order to satisfy regulations such as AML/KYC. We present a privacy-preserving token management system that is designed for permissioned blockchains and supports fine-grained auditing. The scheme is secure under computational assumptions in bilinear groups, in the random-oracle model. We provide performance measurements for our prototype implementation built on top of Hyperledger Fabric.},

	isbn = {978-3-030-75245-3},
	abstract = {Group signature is a major cryptographic tool allowing anonymous access to a service. However, in practice, access to a service is usually granted for some periods of time, which implies that the signing rights must be deactivated the rest of the time. This requirement thus calls for complex forms of revocation, reminiscent of the concept of time-bound keys. However, schemes implementing this concept are rare and only allow revocation with limited granularity. That is, signing keys are associated with an expiry time and become definitively useless once the latter has passed.},

To do so we deﬁne an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisﬁes a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efﬁcient large-domain Veriﬁable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF.},

This is the first verifiable encryption system that provides chosen ciphertext security and avoids inefficient cut-and-choose proofs. The presented protocols have numerous applications, including key escrow, optimistic fair exchange, publicly verifiable secret and signature sharing, universally composable commitments, group signatures, and confirmer signatures.",
